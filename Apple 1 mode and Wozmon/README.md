Here you will find the original Apple 1 manual etc.

Also the 16k Rom Image that has a Software Compatatble version of Apple 1 replica software on it. It supports most programs written in integer basic, however since it does not have a 6821 chip on the board any software that accesses thatchip directly will not work. It may be possible, if you have the source code, to recompile a version for this ROM.
