These are the modified source files for the apple 1 code. They compile in different ways, all except integer basic can be compiled using the 6502 emulator / compiler by Michal kowalaski

Basic is compiled with the CA65 assembler from the CC65 package.

At the moment you have to manually program the ROM by loading the compiled bits and peices into an image, either using DD or your eprom programming software.
