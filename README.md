These are few BASIC programs and other reference documents for the 6502 BASIC computer, the programs are text, you can upload them by cut-n-past. 

Depending of your board etc, you may need to set a character delay of end of line delay in your terminal software.

The EnhancedBasic Folder holds a compiled ROM for version 2.22 of Enhanced BASIC language reference By Lee Davison.
This was obtained from the wayback machine, I can only find other peoples version of this. Not 100% sure of the copyright,
as far as I can see it's open source.

Have fun
